* Some days are split into two parts
* Some days are bundled together and display the results for both parts
* Run the programs:
```sh
cd day<num>
cat example.txt | go run .
cat input.txt | go run .
```
* Starting from day 6 the program also accepts the name of the file as first positional argument, e.g.
`go run . input.txt`
